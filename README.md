#  Breeze icon pack with continued third-party icons support.

This is a PKGBUILD to install this on Arch Linux and derivatives. Simply use makepkg and this should install just fine.

#  Notice

The PKGBUILD here is heavily based on the one found [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/breeze-icons-git) by Gustavo Alvarez and FadeMind. Please direct your gratitude towards them.
